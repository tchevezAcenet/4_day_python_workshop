    "# Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a powerful library in Python that helps with numerical and scientific computing. It allows you to work with large, multi-dimensional arrays (think of them as grids of numbers) and provides many mathematical functions to perform calculations on these arrays quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use NumPy?\n",
    "- **Speed:** NumPy is much faster than using regular Python lists for numerical calculations. It’s written in C, which helps it run faster. When you use NumPy, you can perform operations on big sets of data quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convenience:** With NumPy, you can do calculations on entire arrays without writing long loops. For example, adding two arrays together can be done in just one line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Useful Functions:** NumPy has many built-in functions for doing complex math. This is really helpful in fields like oceanography, where scientists need to work with large amounts of data and perform a lot of calculations."
